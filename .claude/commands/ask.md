## Context

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask clarifying questions and refine requirements before starting implementation.

## Your task

Ask the user clarifying questions to better understand the task requirements.

### Guidelines

1. **Identify ambiguities** in the current request
2. **Use AskUserQuestion** to present options or ask for clarification
3. **Focus on:**
   - Implementation approach preferences
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Scope boundaries (what to include/exclude)
   - Technical constraints or preferences

### Example Questions

- "Which approach would you prefer for X?"
- "Should this handle Y edge case?"
- "What should happen when Z occurs?"
- "Do you want this to be A or B?"

After gathering answers, summarize the clarified requirements.
